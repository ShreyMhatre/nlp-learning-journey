# NLP Learning Journey

Welcome to my **Natural Language Processing (NLP) Learning Journey**!  
This repository documents my exploration, experiments, and learnings as I dive deeper into the fascinating world of NLP.

## About This Repository

This repository is my personal log and practice ground while learning about NLP concepts, algorithms, and applications. Here, you'll find my notes, code experiments, and reflections as I progress through various NLP topics.

My main goal is to strengthen my understanding of how computers process, analyze, and generate human language. The journey includes hands-on coding exercises, projects, and summaries of key NLP concepts.

## Credits

A significant part of my learning in NLP has been guided by the excellent resources in the [@microsoft/AI-For-Beginners](https://github.com/microsoft/AI-For-Beginners) repository, especially the materials in [`/lessons/5-NLP`](https://github.com/microsoft/AI-For-Beginners/tree/main/lessons/5-NLP).  
Many exercises and concepts explored here are inspired by or adapted from their freely available lessons.
